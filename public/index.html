<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/amazon_fire_hd_7-6689.php">Kindle Fire HD 7</a> for around £50 during Amazon&rsquo;s recent &lsquo;Prime Day&rsquo; sale.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s now been supplanted by Amazon&rsquo;s low-cost <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00Y3TM6CO">Fire</a> offering, which seems to be largely the same device (albeit with a slightly lower resolution), so most of this post probably holds true for that device too.</p>

<h3 id="why:7272601f3bafbed2ae37022f5ad8c58c">Why?</h3>

<p>The device was supposed to be a half-way point between my Kindle and laptop - something portable that would allow me to read PDFs of things that don&rsquo;t convert well to e-book format (Programming book / books in Farsi / anything that&rsquo;s been badly scanned), without the distractions of something that&rsquo;s connected to the internet and full of other distractions.</p>

<h3 id="and:7272601f3bafbed2ae37022f5ad8c58c">And?</h3>

<p>So far, things have worked out surprisingly well. I&rsquo;ve managed to resist the temptation to install any apps on there or to use the web browser much. Keeping it permanently in Aeroplane mode has meant that there&rsquo;s just enough overhead to doing something online that I&rsquo;ll switch to my laptop if needed.</p>

<p>The built-in PDF reader is basic but works well for my needs (reading a book one page at a time, cover-to-cover). It allows skipping to different page numbers, but no e.g table-of-contents functionality:</p>

<p><img src="images/kindle/Kindle1.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been loading documents on via USB, being on OSX means that I have to use the Android file transfer app (rather than the tablet presenting itself as a block USB device), which is mildy annoying but not too much of a pain. It also seems to be very fussy about where things are placed - everything needs to go in <em>documents/</em> and trying to organise books via subfolders (e.g <em>documents/computing/</em>) causes them to be ignored.</p>

<p>One minor-but-actually-quite-annoying thing is that PDF covers aren&rsquo;t picked up for side-loaded documents, meaning that my UI has ended up being full of default covers (see below). This seems to have been an issue since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&amp;cdThread=TxM9YB62T1DLCN">2011</a> and seems like a weird one to not have fixed. The only reason I can think of is that Amazon really don&rsquo;t expect/want the device to be used in this way - Fire OS seems very much to be designed as a slick content consumption experience, provided that you buy in fully to the Amazon ecosystem (Prime Video, Photo Storage etc.):</p>

<p><img src="images/kindle/Kindle2.png" alt="" class="pure-img" ></p>

<p>Battery life has been better than I expected - I haven&rsquo;t done any scientific testing, but I generally get a few days of solid reading (3-4 hours per day) before I need to dig out the charger. It also charges very quickly, but needs the provided charger (all of my other microUSB chargers were deemed to be too low-power by it).</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I finding it less straining on my eyes than my laptop, but more so than my Kindle (which is what I&rsquo;d expect). Combined with the lack of other distractions on there, this makes it usually possible to read on there at night without affecting my ability to go to sleep.</p>

<h3 id="tl-dr:7272601f3bafbed2ae37022f5ad8c58c">TL;DR?</h3>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;d definitely recommend the Fire HD 7 (or the new Fire tablet) with the caveat that I&rsquo;m recommending it for my exact use case. For less than £50, I&rsquo;ve been able to do a lot more distraction-free reading that I would have on my laptop.</p>
